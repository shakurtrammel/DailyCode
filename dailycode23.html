		<h1>Floated Layouts</h1>
		<p>Floating elements is fun, but I think it works better when applied to a single element as opposed to laying out an entire page with it. The red section above is a div that is containing three paragraphs that are each floated left. Easy to implement, but I suppose that is so because the containing div has a fixed height. I'm sure things will get complicated quickly in a fluid/responsive layou. It's pretty clear that floating is not a good way to create layouts.</p>
