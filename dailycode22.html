		22 consecutive days of code and counting! Today's code is layout focused...I'm mostly interested in layout right now. Working with the smaller iPhone 5 screen size challenges me to make interesting layouts with a small number of elements. I haven't hit upon anything exciting, but I'm sure I will as I keep coding everyday. Javascript is coming soon. at the moment, I'm really into CSS and making mobile layouts.
