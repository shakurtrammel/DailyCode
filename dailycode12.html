		This is a continuation of yesterday's work on my blog interface. I found a tyepface that I like. I may stick with it for the final render. The "Blog" link element is enclosed within a border to let my user know that she is at the "Blog" page. I'm exploring better options for that. I also removed the border around the section to see what the layout looks like on its own. I'm going with a predominantly typographic site and layout and then progressively enhance with imagery, video and sound.
