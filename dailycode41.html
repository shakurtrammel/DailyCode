				I envisioned today's design to be a simple graphic with tyopgraphic expressiveness. I wanted to code a "pixel perfect" render of my original sketch, which I actually achieved. Although I'm doing well in the coding of my designs, the concepts are still a bit fuzzy. To illustrate, I used the border property of the two triangles to achieve the shape, but I had to search for a way to do it online. I would of been stuck if there wasn't a how-to online. Also, a SVG would of been better to use for the shapes and what I put together was a css hack. I give myself credit for stretching today (I've mastered absolute positioning) and accomplishing the goal, but I'm an engineer and engineers don't hack things together. We build important, value things for society to use. We use knowledge and principles. Science and art.

			If a user encountered this page, would they be able to engage it beyond just looking at it? Is it accessible? It is mostly inaccessible. The divs I used for the shapes contain no information for my users...they have no meaning. The words are almost nonsensical. Unless you were familiar with the lorem ipsum reference, how would you know what this phrase is? I want to move away from design like this...design without purpose, without function. Without function it is decoration. That's not the type of creator I am. The web is so much more than a technology. It is information, learning, access, empowerment, improvement. Whether I am designing or engineering, there is meaning to what I am doing. I have an effect. My work matters. I would like to have a meaningful, positive effect for the good of society and humanity.
