				Exciting times today: I finally wrote my first Javascript code! It's been a long time coming. I wanted to make sure that I had the core concepts of HTML and CSS down before I started working with JS and I'm glad that I did. I wrote an HTML div tag, place the text "Javascript time!" inside of the div using javascript and styled the div with css. I also wrote my first React program today, which is outside the scope of DailyCode, so I'm glad about that too. I've been improving my devlopment skills everyday for the past two months and it hasn't been easy but I'm committed and determined to make my way as a developer and to become a great web engineer. Today I broke some major ground and I'm happy about that.

				On another note, I'm going to expand DailyCode and start using libraries/tools. While it's great to improve my standard HCJ skills, contemporary web development is framework/library/tool heavy and I want to build with modern tools not just vanilla HCJ. These tools have a learning curve themselves and I need to learn them. Also, I think I will get better at vanilla HCJ and programming in general by using these tools.
