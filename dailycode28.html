				Today I made a much better vizualization of the relationship between the content-elements and the negative space of the screen. What immediately comes to mind is BORING. lol. But it is orderly and familiar. Old school computer style. 
				<br>
				<br>
				The question is: How can I layout boxes of text in an interesting way while putting the content and UX first? Some solutions that immediately come to mind are to dive deeper into layout/grids, to use typographic SVGs and to use animation (yes! I love motion!). Deeper layouts and animation sound like winners. I really want to be great at engineering on the web...apps, UIs, whatever. I believe that good engineering starts with good design and I'm grateful that I get to design and build as a web developer because I really enjoy designing too. I should get some rest but my mind is buzzing about grids and the bauhaus right now.
