				Another simple graphic today but I learned more as well by keeping it simple. yet creative. I'm bading these graphics off of sketches that I draw in a graph pad and the results are very straightforward. It's more calculation and structure than anything which I enjoy a great deal. The svg elements I used in this graphic are a rectangle, circle, line and polygon. The keys to understanding how to "draw" these elements are the coordinate system, points and measurement. It's geometry basically. And very easy to implement.

				When I started with graphics this week I intended to focus on svg. However, svg seems to be specifically for 2d graphics and webGL is specifically for 3D graphics. I know for sure that basic 3D shapes will be easy for me to implement so I may give it a try during this week.
