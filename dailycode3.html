Problem today: getting the header to display the text and getting the font-family displayed using @font-face. 
Wasn't able to use the fonts I wanted to and the content of certain elements wouldn't display unless I set rules for the body element. Also, some weird stuff went down when I tried to put a paragraph element in the header element. I also forgot to "save as" and overwrote yesterday's DailyCode files. smh. Today's design had alot of issues!
</p>
<p>
I got the typefaces to display correctly in Chrome and Safari, but not in Firefox. I wonder why? I'm pretty sure it has something to do with the css I'm writing and/or the the font file format. The fonts wouldn't display properly until I changed the "font-family" value in the @font-face rule (no underscores in the name?). I was only able to use one cusotom font in Chrome. Good problems. I still have time before the day ends to fix them. My end goal is to get the same presentation in all three browsers.
</p>
<p>A quick note on the typography: I really like Bebas Neue. Has a great vibe to it and instantly upgrades the design. It's like Impact but better. I wonder why?
</p>
<p>
Result: Design works across Chrome and Safari but custom font won't display in Firefox. I think that Firefox only supports WOFF and I only have the OTF version of the font.
