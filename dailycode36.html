				Wasn't able to write much code today, but I displayed the borders around the elements on this page to gain a better understanding of how they're actually showing up on the screen. I need to work with meangingful content with these views. I used flexbox to layout these elements and it works so much better than using floating or positioning hacks to layout the screen. However, flexbox is best used for 1-dimensional layout, thanks Rachel Andrew, in rows or columns. What I really need is Grid Layout for 2-dimensional layouts, but they're not supported in any current browser. I will still master it and use prefixes where I can, but I must admit: the web development industry seems to do things rather foolishly at times. A proper tool/technique for layout should have been created long ago...why does the industry operate this way? Is it because it is young?
