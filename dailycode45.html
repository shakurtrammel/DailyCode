				Very, very nice time working with SVG today. Aside from the fact that creating vector graphics is more like drawing, which I love to do and am the most naturally talented in among all of the visual arts, SVG has a ton of really nice features for web des/dev. From a visual point of view, SVG will be a critical part of the web (if it isn't already). Looking forward to learning more.

				From a design perspective, typography works really well when it is paired with shapes. The type becomes more interesting visually and it presents less as words and more as graphic. I can see a way to expand my use of typography by pairing it with shapes.

				I noticed that I liked working more with graphics than I did with type. Maybe I don't find type to be that interesting? Or maybe I think more of reading when I see type than I do visuals? I have definitely seen some great type that I appreciated solely for the way it looked...maybe its the size of the mobile screen that's throwing me off? I haven't really mastered type. I work with helvetica all of the time and still haven't managed to get it looking the way that I would like to. Maybe it's time to actually master my design chops?
