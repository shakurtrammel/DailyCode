		Today's code is ok. I am working with layout: floating and the box properties. I'm bored with the plain black and white colorway, but I know it's better for me design-wise to leave out color for now. I'm still conceptually fuzzy about how text works within its container element. If I make the text bigger, does the element increase in size? If the font-size of text is 32px,  how much space is the text actually taking up in its container element?
