				Today is my last day of typographic focus for this month. It's been a week already...I'm 5 weeks into 2017. My output throughout this week has been simple: not too bad but not extraordinary either. However, I have developed some great insights into engineering mobile UIs in general and mobile typography specifically. The key takeaways from this week are: "snapshot" layouts in sections, type as functional blocks (i.e. paragraph, heading, aside) vs type as letterforms, the reality context of type, and the constraints of type due to limited available space within the screen. There is still much to learn regarding typography. I'm great at understanding and using properties, whether they're CSS properties or typographic properties. I can improve my layout skills and delve deeper into typography in general.
