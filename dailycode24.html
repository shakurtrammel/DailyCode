		<p class="articlebody">
			Today I learned how to position elements using the <em>Position</em> property in CSS. It's a much better way to layout an overall interface than using floats for everything, but it's still not ideal it seems. The rectangular form-factor of computer screens can get boring aesthetically, but is helpful to think about structurally. I am beginning to get a feel for the spatial characteristics of the phone screen and the relationships that my graphical elements can have with and within it. My natural preferences are already taking root: I am happily getting lost in the aesthetic, scientific, mathematical and technical aspects of the UI and spending less time thinking about users. But that's ok. Even though I'm sharing with the world, DailyCode is for my personal tastes. I'm glad to have something just for me, where I can go as far as I would like to.
