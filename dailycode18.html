		For today's code I wanted to get a sense of proportion and available space for my blog interface. On the iPhone 5 I have 320px/460px screen to work with. It seems like it will be enough space for me to present a good interface for my blog's admin home screen. Working small helps to prioritize content and to keep the interface simple. Today is the 18th consecutive day I've coded up a page and today's date is January 12, 2017. Good to go!
