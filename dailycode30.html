				Today is my 30th consecutive day of code. I've learned a lot so far, especially regarding CSS. Since I started DailyCode on December 26th of last year, I still have a few more days left in January. I'm going to continue exploring layout techniques in CSS to close out January and then pick a new focus for Febuary. I'm happy I was able to stick to my daily code these past 30 days. On to 60!
