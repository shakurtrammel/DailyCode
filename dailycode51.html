				I worked through some good process-related stuff today. I didn't know where to start today. I was bored with the basic svg shapes but I didn't know how to make anything more complex. I thought about skipping today's code (of course) or maybe writing some back end code to keep the chain going. I didn't want to skip so I decided to write some code, however simple. I couldn't escape to the back end because DailyCode is strictly about the front end: design then build using front end technologies. The final constraint that I couldn't wiggle out of was that this week is strictly about working with graphics (today is the last day for graphics although I may continue to work with graphics and type). So I decided to stick with my plan for DailyCode. Glad I did.

			To solve this dilemma, I first looked for inspiration in other designers' work online. Tobias van Schneider got me going today. Next, I grabbed my sketchbook and started drawing. Finally, I used the svg elements that seemed to work best for my drawing and started coding (I design and implement in the browser). Since I sketch on graph paper it was easy for me to calculate the coordinates and proportions of the shapes. I used the text, and polygon elements for today's design. The polygon is off a bit, but that's ok. I learned a lot about how it works. I also worked with the path element today (which is amazing), but I scrapped the object I made with path. I was also bolder in size and contrast with my type and this worked out very well for the design. Very good session today and glad I moved past the plateau.
