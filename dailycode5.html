		Nice work today. I decided to work with a web-safe font for today's design: <span style="font-style:italic">Times New Roman</span>. i think it looks great. It displays really well across all of the browsers and was super-easy to work with. The typeface is also well-suited to article-type stuff obviously. Working with a web-safe font forced me to explore font properties in CSS more thoroughly because I wanted to make the design look good...and interesting. Maybe I'll work with a web-safe sans-serif tomorrow.

		I finally figured out how to set  border properties! It sounds simple enough, but the style wouldn't render when I tried to set the widths of individual borders using a single border declaration. I can use the single declaration to set the style for each individual border, but not all at the same time.

		I coded a different design from the one I drew. That's because I realized that I was designing with a mobile-first mentality and my original idea wouldn't work that well from a mobile point of view. I sketched a two-column layout, but mobile screens aren't that wide so I found it better to stack content vertically. I don't know how to make responsive layouts yet, so I'll stick with the mobile-centric layouts for now to keep things simple. I'm excited about making designs that change depending on what screen it is being viewed on. Each screen has its benefits.

		It's definitely time to make a better way to write this text. i'm currently writing this directly into the HTML document, marking it up with p tags and line-break tags. I'd rather type this into the browser page and store it there. Having all of the content directly coded into the HTML document makes the document cluttered (even though I code neatly). I think the HTML file should contain elements, the CSS file should contain styles, the JS file should contain programs and the content should live elsewhere. I guess that's what the database is for!
