				Simple design today. Changed the font to Helvetica Neue vs Helvetica with some definite improvements. I focused on proportions today, dividing the screen up into proportioned areas. I used a combination of normal flow, floats and flexboxes to accomplish the layout. Flexbox works wonderfully when arranging elements in one dimension within a container. Of course for 2d layout CSS Grid is better but the browser support is still not there so I'm pretty much ignoring it right now.

				My use of word-spacing in combination with justified text is still not the way I'd like for it to be. I'll have to read up on it this time. You probably noticed that I've removed the footer in the last few designs. I think it works better for mobile screens to have a stripped-down footer or none at all. also, i'm thinking simple "snapshot" layouts for mobile sites. It seems that snapshots will be implemented well using React components...React-Native. I want to point out that it took me 43 days to come to these conclusions. I love this DailyCode project. It points out so many great principles of craftsmanship. I'll be able to do extraordinary work in no time.
