		Today's code is a continuation of my blog interface development. Working with just the navigation and header components has already yielded a great deal of insight. I'm learning quite a bit! My blog is all about my users. I want them to be able to enjoy reading my blog and learning. Reading comfort is paramount and navigation is supreme too. Easy on the eyes and hands. Open, lightweight and spacious interface. I want to leave room for the expereience of functionality when I feature javascript. Typography is SUPER important...I'm going to keep looking around for faces. The face I have now might be a bit too round. Tomorrow, come hell or high water, I'm building out as much of the site as I can and I'm making my first post.
