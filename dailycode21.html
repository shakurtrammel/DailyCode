		Working with some basic layout stuff today. Initially, I thought that HTML5 would be my main focus since that's where web pages begin. CSS (and Javascript) is where it's at though. Sure, it's critical that my HTML be properly coded, but after the structure is ordered the main focus becomes presentation. And that's design/CSS.
