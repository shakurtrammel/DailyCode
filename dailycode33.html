				Today I continued to work with headers (and layout). How can I make the header simple, functional and interesting? And still leave room for the nav up there? Which should come first: header or nav? I realized that type only takes you so far when it comes to making an interesting layout. Type works really well with negative space in creating an open, clean layout but it can get boring quick. I haven't incorporated color yet. I'd like to continue to work with form. I think that approach will yield great results. I started reading the CSS Shapes specification module. Turns out there's a whole lot going on there with plenty of new developments. Shapes can be made with some pure CSS, ranging from simple squares and circles to complex shapes like stars and arrows. I wonder if there are better ways to create shapes to use on web pages?
