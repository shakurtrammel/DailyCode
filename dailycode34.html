				The mobile page-interface has a rectangular form factor, with a proportioned width/height and the height being greater in vlaue than the width. The smartphone canvas is a touchscreen made of glass and the primary tool for manipulating the screen is the digits of the hand. Why are people using the smartphone to browse the web? To interact with the content/perform a task. The interface for a user should enable the user to perform the desired tasks with ease, enjoyment and speed. The elements of the interface should serve to optimize the user experience as they perform tasks using the interface. Every element has a functional purpose and reason for being that is task-related. Not decorative. I must look deeper to the essence of the tasks, the user the content and the internet. The interface is derived from the relationship between these elements.
