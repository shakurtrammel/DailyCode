			Good job today! Things went a lot smoother than yestaerday. My focus was on typography today: choosing good header and body combinations. That's <span style="font-style:italic">Chunk5</span> in the header and <span style="font-style:italic">Garamond</span> in the body. Not too bad. I have to create a typography workflow that will streamline the process of working with text. I still have to find a way to get clean copies of fonts in the formats that all of the browsers support because this design breaks in Firefox.

			Margins and padding make a huge difference for laying out elements visually. Positive/negative space is the center of today's design. I thought I would have trouble working with the box model but I was able to apply the concept easily. I used the W3C reference to get the margin, padding and border properties syntax down. Good to go. The heights of the elements are fixed in pixels. I wanted to center the design on the page but I'll have to get it to it tomorrow because I'm out of time.

			I'm also writing better HTML semantically. My code looks cleaner, more organized and it makes more sense regarding what the content is or means. Just by looking at an outline of the tags I can tell what this page is and I can make a good guess as to what kind of info the page contains. I was also able to style the page a lot easier. It appears that what a lot of developers have been saying is true: there are many benefits to building structurally sound HTML.

      		Sidenote: The header typeface is not displaying in CodePen at the moment. It is displaying fine in all of the browsers. Interesting...
