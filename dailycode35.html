				Made some improvements today. I like the direction I'm going regarding my headers. I just keep eliminating the superfluous and unecessary. Designing for mobile is a real pleasure. There's isn't enough room for the unnessary and that's my way naturally. Eliminating the superfluous is derived from a user/conent/component-centric focus. What service am I providing to my users? Why? Assuming that I am providing information, what is the nature of this info? It's function, form and behavior? How can I present this information to my users in the most appropriate fashion (given the project requirements and my own principles as an engineer)? How do I structure this information as a performant component? This line of reasoning may just be my creative process and if it is I have surely evolved as a maker of things.
