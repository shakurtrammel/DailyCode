				Unmotivated today: I want to move on to building apps but there's still much to get right design-wise. I' being patient and continuing to do the right things. Time to dig in and drive on. I kept it simple today since I'm going to bed early tonight. My best bet is to work with type and simple graphics (lines, shapes and forms) as I continue to explore layout. There's also responsive/adaptive layout considerations to work with as well. For now though, focusing on the smartphone screen is a good strategy. Today's design looks like it could be a good landing page. I'm going to find a full Helvetica family so that i can deepen my font/text skills in CSS. I'm also looking forward to using SVG.
