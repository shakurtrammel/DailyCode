				Today's code was a lot of fun. I ran into a bunch of conditions working with type and had to think my way through implementation. Styling type is different from styling boxes. I began by specifying box properties but that wasn't working well for my intentions. I scrapped that approach and used the text-formatting and font-styling properties. That worked much better.

				I need to ensure that I prepare my content for use. I used the Lorem Ipsum generator to grab some generic text for the paragraph and if you notice the word-spacing in the first two sentences is larger than the spacing of the last sentence. I set the word-spacing for the element and it worked in the last sentence but not the first two sentences. I reason that the text came with some behind-the-scenes formatting from the generator. Will clean that up next go round.

				Helvetica is such an interesting typeface. I've been working with it for years, it's used all over the place, and I'm still learning things about it. I think I'm going to keep working with it over this week actually. There was a weird behavior when I removed the font-family that used the Google font. i'm going to look into that tomorrow perhaps.
