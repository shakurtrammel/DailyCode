				Smooth workflow today. I finished about 20 minutes earlier than yesterday. I worked with the overall feel of the content on a smartphone screen, which ultimately led to an exploration of the relative weights of the elements on the page. I think type will be best used in an airy, open layout with lots of space. I like the placemnent of my header but the nav menu and footer don't look right. I think footers are unnecessary...I've never seen a footer that I actually liked. I also want to do away with the nav menu at the upper corners of the page, but how will people know how to get around the site? I coded up a fixed layout today using an absolute positioning scheme. It was a real joy to use a grid with a base unit of measurement and a scale of sizes. My base unit was 16px. Such a good unit to work with.
