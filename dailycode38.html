				As promised I moved on to greener pastures in DailyCode today. In February I'm deepening my skills in styling content types that are common on the web: type, photos, video and graphics. One content type per week, so today I worked with type.
			</p>
			<p class="articlebody">
				I enclosed all of the type elements in borders in today's layout. This border is outlining the elements' content box. The width/height of this box is set by the width/height of the content within it, in this case the type. The size of the type is determined by its font-size, font-weight, line-height, letter-spacing, etc. Once I've chosen the typeface to work with it will be wise to structure each type element as a component and then to layout the components along a grid. It will be easier to layout the type accoring to proportions and other relationships. I definitely don't want to use a serif display face (unless its a slab maybe).
			</p>
			<p class="articlebody">
				Last, it's interesting that using the letterforms and generic text to make design decisions only go so far. In the case of the letterforms, "type" on a page means more "functional type module" and less "letters". So the letters themselves can tell you about x-height, ascenders, or purpose, but it can't tell you if the face will actually work for your design. You need to see the face in action as a title, subtitle, parapgraph, etc. In the case of the generic text, the type has to be read and reading is a complex process. It's best to use the actual text to determine whether the face works or not. Although there are many decadent aspects of typography culturally, typography itself is couched in reality. I like that about it.
